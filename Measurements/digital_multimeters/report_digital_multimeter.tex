	\section{Introduction to Digital Multi-meters}
	Digital multi-meters, also known as DMMs, are electronic instruments used to measure multiple electrical properties. They typically feature a numeric display, such as a liquid crystal display, to provide accurate readings of the measured quantities. DMMs utilize an analog to digital converter (ADC) to convert electrical signals into digital data for display, enabling precise measurements of voltage, current, resistance, and other parameters.
	
	The basic principles of DMMs involve the use of ADCs, which may have resolution levels of 12 to 16 bits, and a sample and hold stage to ensure accurate measurement of varying wave-forms. These instruments have become more accurate, compact, and capable of measuring additional parameters like frequency, capacitance, continuity, and temperature, making them essential for a wide range of applications in electronics and electrical engineering.

	\section{Bench-top DMMs}
	Digital multi-meters (DMMs) come in various types, each catering to specific needs and applications. Understanding the differences between bench-top vs. handheld multi-meters, auto-ranging vs. manual ranging DMMs, and specialized DMMs for specific applications is crucial for selecting the right tool for the job. \\ \\
	Benchtop DMMs:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Bench-top DMMs are larger and designed for use on a workbench or in automated system test racks.
		\item They offer higher accuracy, better resolution, and more sophisticated system programmability compared to handheld DMMs.
		\item Connectivity options include USB, GPIB, LAN, and RS-232, with SCPI language compatibility for remote programming.
		\item Bench-top DMMs are not limited by power and usually have higher performance, albeit being power-hungry.
		\item They are favored by engineers, researchers, product designers, and test engineers due to their accuracy, wide measurement range, and connectivity to computers. (2), (3)
	\end{itemize}
	Handheld DMMs:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Handheld DMMs are portable and offer simple functions, making them popular among technicians and electricians.
		\item They provide basic connectivity options such as USB or Bluetooth, and some models offer mobile applications for added convenience.
		\item While they may have lower accuracy and resolution compared to bench-top DMMs, their portability and simplicity make them suitable for on-the-go measurements in various environments. (3), (4)
	\end{itemize}
	
	\section{Components and Features}
	Digital multi-meters (DMMs) encompass various components and features that enable them to perform a wide range of measurements. Understanding the display types, input jacks and selector switch, and measurement functions is essential for utilizing these instruments effectively. \\ \\
	Display Types:
